# Sequential and Binary Search

This section covers two fundamental search algorithms implemented in C++:

1. [Sequential Search](01-sequential-search.md)
2. [Binary Search](02-binary-search.md)
3. [Comparison of Search Methods](03-comparison.md)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, students will be able to:

- Understand how sequential and binary search algorithms work
- Implement both algorithms in C++
- Analyze and compare the time and space complexity of both algorithms
- Identify scenarios where each algorithm is most appropriate
- Apply these algorithms to solve practical problems in competitive programming
